Week 08 - Property Based Testing
================================


This is a written version of [Lecture
\#8](https://youtu.be/JMRwkMgaBOg).

In this lecture we cover another state machine example, automatic
testing using emulator traces, optics, and property-based testing.

This week we were using Plutus commit
ae35c4b8fe66dd626679bd2951bd72190e09a123, the same commit as we used in
the last lecture.
