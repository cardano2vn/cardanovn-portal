Week 10 - Uniswap
=================


These is a written version of [Lecture
\#10](https://youtu.be/Dg36h9YPMz4).

In this lecture we look at an implementation of Uniswap in Plutus.

This is the last lecture in the Plutus Pioneer Program. However, there
will be a special lecture once it is possible to deploy contracts to the
testnet.
